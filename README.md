Especially useful for programmers/developers, artists, power users, etc., that might have dozens of folders and multilevel nested folder trees to manage.

## Features
* Selection of 14 colors based on the pleasant Google Material Design palette.  
* 100% Free Open Source. You can known what it's made of and freely modify, remove, or add features to it.  
* Minimalist, systems-level designed. Consists of a single executable with an embedded icons resource. Less than one megabyte size in total.  
* Secure design: Absolute minimal API usage, using zero network calls. No adware, no nag screens, data collection, and   doesn't use a vulnerable Explorer shell extension like others do.  

## Requirements  
Windows 7,8, or 10 32bit or 64bit OS.

## Motivation
After trying several commercial and free implementations of similar coloring tools, they were all lacking in one way or another.  Many had security red flags, advertising pop-ups, odd color schemes, using bloated Windows explorer shell Extensions, and/or with disagreeable license terms.  
I could see there really wasn't that much too them functionally so it was time to roll my own, make the better simpler one that I desired and then share with others.
